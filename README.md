# WeatherAPP

In this assignment I used a Server-Side API called openWeather App to retrieve data and build a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. I used the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to weather data for cities. I used `local storage` to store any persistent data. The traveler will be able to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that they can plan a trip. When they search for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. The app provides you with current weather for cities including city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, temparature, humidity, wind speed, and the UV index. When the UV index shows you also see a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. When someone views future weather conditions for that city then they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions , the temperature, and the humidity. When someone clicks on city in the search history then they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and when someone opens the dashboard they are presented with last searched city forecast.In this assignment I used a Server-Side API called openWeather App to retrieve data and build a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
